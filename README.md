# Advent-Of-Code-2016
### 2016's AoC Challenges
Advent Of Code (adventofcode.com) is an online challenge that takes place in December. Every day until Christmas (including Christmas actually), there are 2 programming challenges that you need to solve to accomplish a task (2016's task, save Christmas!). Solving the first challenge opens the second for you. The challenges are time based, so scoring is based on how fast you solve the problem.

These are my solutions for all of the problems that were given. A lot of them might be "easy" solutions, but honestly, I don't care as I am writing this going into Day 8, and when it is time to worry about efficiency, I will.

Enjoy!

**12/8/16 Update:** 16 stars awarded so far and I've gotten 100% of them!
**12/18/16 Update:** 31 stars awarded so far.. about to be 32 (100%)!

Note: I didn't have code for Day 11 because I did it on paper.
